### Motivation
NoYouPick.io was initally created because there needed to be a fair way to solve the problem of not knowing where to eat when you are with a group of friends or a significant other. This problem appeared enough times where it actually made sense to create an application to figure it out easily and avoid the frustration. Now, the entire group can eat with ease because NoYouPick.io reccomends the restuarant that recieved the most votes by all group members. Since then, we have generalized NoYouPick.io to cover more categories such as movies with more on the way!
